# Crushing Bugs
Use the in-class build files (the Puzzle Drag and Drop) and fix the bugs that were discovered in class.

## Fixing some bugs.
TODO: Fix some bugs. After that, all things are uploaded on Github.
This is [a written plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11JHdTprt9iAghgzMKJlTvR8jqzoMGdQK7C0-9ZdaQ9g/edit?usp=sharing).


### Problems
  - The user can drag and drop any puzzle piece into a drop zone.
  - Puzzle pieces should be reset when the user chooses another puzzle.
